Add social share icons to single posts within GeneratePress Theme

== Description ==

This plugin hooks into the generate_after_content hook to append social share icons to the single post page by default.

It uses the if_single() WordPress hook to ensure only fires on all single posts.

Configured shared content:

Image = post featured Image - full url
Title = post title
Content = the first 40 words of the content
URL = the post permalink

== Social Media Channels ==
These are the social channels currently supported by the plugin
* Facebook
* Twitter
* Google+
* Pinterest
* LinkedIn
* WhatsApp
* Email

== Installation ==

Ensure GeneratePress is your current active theme


1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/plugin-name` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Appearance->GP Social Share screen to add your own SVG code for the icons and choose your hook placement

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I use outside of hooks =

You can use the following shortcode
	[gp-social]

= Nothing happens when I activate the plugin =

Ensure you have the GeneratePress Theme active.

= Do I have to use the premium version of the GeneratePress Theme? =

No. This plugin works with the theme and does not require the premium plugin.

= What if the hook I want to use isnt in the option, want it in multiple locations or want to apply some condtional logic? =

You can use the following action to display the social share options whenever/wherever you like, just change out the_hook_you_require for the one you want to use

	add_action( 'the_hook_you_require','add_social_icons' );


= Can I display the amount of times my post has been shared? =

No. This plugin does not use any API's or receive any data from the shared content. It is intentionally built to be light weight.

= Can I change the email body? =

Yes. Just add a function called gp_social_email_body which returns your body content.

= Can I use the media uploader to upload SVG icons? =

No. WordPress has SVG disabled by default due to potential security issues, the decision was made to support this and stick to inline SVG code.
